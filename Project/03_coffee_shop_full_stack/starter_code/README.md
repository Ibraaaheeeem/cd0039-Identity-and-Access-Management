# Coffee Shop Full Stack

## Full Stack Nano - IAM Final Project

### THE TASK
Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled cafe for students to order drinks, socialize, and study hard. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

You have been called on to demonstrate your newly learned skills to create a full stack drink menu application. The application must:

1. Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2. Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3. Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4. Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

## About the Stack

The full stack application have been started. It is designed with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The `./backend` directory contain a partially completed Flask server with a pre-written SQLAlchemy module to simplify the data needs. The tasks included completing the required endpoints, configuring, and integrating Auth0 for authentication.


### Frontend

The `./frontend` directory contain a complete Ionic frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. The task here wws to update the environment variables found within (./frontend/src/environment/environment.ts) to reflect the Auth0 configuration details set up for the backend app.
